# Enhancement Three: Databases :books:

Artifact Three represents a significant enhancement to the original SlideShow application by integrating MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to manage slide data dynamically. This enhancement transforms the application from a static, hardcoded slideshow into a flexible, data-driven system with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities.

Key Features

- MongoDB Integration: Replaced hardcoded slide data with a MongoDB database for dynamic data management.
- CRUD Operations: Implemented functionality to Create, Read, Update, and Delete slides through the application.
- Java MongoDB Driver: Utilized the MongoDB Java driver to interact with the database from the Java application.
- Web Interface: Developed a simple web interface using HTML/JavaScript for slide management, demonstrating full-stack development skills.
- RESTful API: Created a basic RESTful API to handle communication between the web interface and the MongoDB database.

Technical Highlights

- Database Design: Structured slide data as documents in MongoDB, showcasing NoSQL database modeling skills.
- Connection Management: Implemented a MongoDB connection manager to handle database operations efficiently.
- Error Handling: Enhanced the application with robust error handling for database operations.
- Performance Optimization: Implemented basic caching and efficient querying techniques to improve application performance.

Skills Demonstrated:

- NoSQL database design and implementation
- Java database integration
- RESTful API development
- Full-stack web development
- Data modeling for document-based databases
- CRUD operation implementation in a database-driven application
