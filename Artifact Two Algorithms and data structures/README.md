# Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures :bar_chart:

The original artifact is a Java-based SlideShow application developed in the CS-250 course. This application displays a series of images and text descriptions about various travel destinations, allowing users to navigate through the slides using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.

Enhancements

To demonstrate proficiency in algorithms and data structures, the following enhancements were implemented:

- Doubly Linked List Implementation: Replaced the original array-based slide storage with a custom doubly linked list, allowing for more efficient insertion, deletion, and navigation of slides.
- Optimized Navigation Algorithm: Developed a new navigation system that utilizes the doubly linked list structure, providing constant-time O(1) complexity for moving between slides.
- Binary Search Algorithm: Implemented a binary search function to quickly locate specific slides by title or index, improving search efficiency from O(n) to O(log n).
- Custom Sorting Algorithm: Created a flexible sorting mechanism that can arrange slides based on various criteria (e.g., alphabetical order of destinations, date added) using a modified merge sort algorithm.


Skills Demonstrated

This enhanced artifact showcases several key skills in algorithms and data structures:

- Design and implementation of custom data structures
- Algorithm analysis and optimization
- Time and space complexity considerations
- Efficient search and sort techniques
- Performance tuning and caching strategies

Impact and Significance

The enhancements significantly improved the SlideShow application's performance and functionality. The new structure allows for more dynamic content management, faster navigation, and improved search capabilities. These improvements demonstrate the ability to apply theoretical computer science concepts to practical software engineering challenges. By reimagining the original project with a focus on algorithmic efficiency and advanced data structures, this artifact represents a substantial evolution in both the codebase and the developer's skills. It serves as a testament to the growth and application of computer science principles throughout the academic program.
